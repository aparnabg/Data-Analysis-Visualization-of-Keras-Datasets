## Introduction

In the era of big data, the ability to analyze and visualize complex datasets is crucial for effective decision-making and model development. Keras, a widely used deep learning framework, provides several datasets that serve as benchmarks for various machine learning tasks. This project delves into four such datasets, exploring them through data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights.

## Datasets
